# About
easy_path is a simple path manipulation library. I've been wanting to separate my path manipulation
code from my IO code, so I figured I'd create a little library for it. It's nothing special, and
there's still a lot of APIs to add, but a few points of interest include:
 - It's made up of just two files - easy_path.h and easy_path.c
 - No dependencies (so far)
 - Never uses the heap
 - Public domain

 
# How to use it
Just add these to your project's source tree and you should be good to go. See easy_path.h for
information on the API.
